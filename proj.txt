FIRST STEP

1.ls(to check  the current state)
2.cd Desktop(to get into desktop)
3.mkdir foldername(to make a folder )
4.cd foldername(to get into the folder)
5.git init 
(The git init command is used to initialize a new Git repository in a directory. When you run git init in a folder, Git creates a new repository in that directory. This repository will store all the version history, branches, and other Git-related information for the files in that directory and its subdirectories.

Here's a breakdown of what git init does:

Initialize Repository: It creates a new subdirectory named .git in the current working directory. This directory contains all the necessary files and directories that Git needs to manage the repository.

Set Up Configuration: Git initializes various configuration files within the .git directory. These files store information about the repository, such as user settings, remote repository URLs, and other configuration options.

Ready for Version Control: Once the repository is initialized, you can start adding files to it and tracking changes. Git will start monitoring the files in the directory and its subdirectories for changes.)
6.touch filename.txt(to create a new file )
7.edit the file in text editor
8.git add .filename.txt(It is called staging )
9.git config --global user.name"      "
10.git conifg --global user.email wasil.ahmad786@gmail.command
11.git commit -m"message"(to commit)
12.git remote add origin URL(to tell where the file is to be pushed in github )
13.git push --set-upstream origin main(to push the file in github)

making some changes in the file and THEN 1.staging 
                                         2.commit
                                         3.push
                                         
SECOND STEP(creating branch and Managing branch)
1.git branch feature-branch(for creating a branch named feature-branch)
2.git checkout name (for navagation between main and branches)
3.git checkout feature-branch 
  git add .filename.txt(staging)
  git commit -m"message"(commit)
  git push (for pushing the file in github )

    making some changes in the the feature branch THEN 1.staging 
                                                       2.commit
                                                       3.push

    MERGING THE BRANCH WITH MAIN
    1.git checkout main
    2.git merge feature-branch
      
      merging branch with main and THEN 1.staging 
                                        2.commit
                                        3.push
