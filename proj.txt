(The git init command is used to initialize a new Git repository in a directory. When you run git init in a folder, Git creates a new repository in that directory. This repository will store all the version history, branches, and other Git-related information for the files in that directory and its subdirectories.

Here's a breakdown of what git init does:

Initialize Repository: It creates a new subdirectory named .git in the current working directory. This directory contains all the necessary files and directories that Git needs to manage the repository.

Set Up Configuration: Git initializes various configuration files within the .git directory. These files store information about the repository, such as user settings, remote repository URLs, and other configuration options.

Ready for Version Control: Once the repository is initialized, you can start adding files to it and tracking changes. Git will start monitoring the files in the directory and its subdirectories for changes.)
